Problem 4 
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

"""
for each result of multiplication of each 3-digit number if it is palindrome then check if it is max_ or not
then return max
